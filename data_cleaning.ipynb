    "\n",
    "While we will be going through the data cleaning process step-by-step, let's first talk about data. Where do I get my data? How do I know if it is good data? What does good data look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the foundation of any machine learning project. It can come from various sources, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository)\n",
    "- Company databases\n",
    "- APIs (e.g., Twitter, Google Maps)\n",
    "- Web scraping\n",
    "- Manual data entry\n",
    "\n",
    "So as you can see, data can come from a tone of places. Really what you want to do for data collection is to first ask yourself, \"Is this data free to use?\" In instances like company databases, for personal projects, of course you cannot use the data. If you are working with an API check the docs to see if there are any restrictions on usage. Public datasets are usually free to use, but always check the license. A quick 90 seconds of research can save you later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you've got your data, what now? Is it good data? Good data is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relevant**: It should relate to the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
    "- **Accurate**: It should be correct and free of errors.\n",
    "- **Complete**: It should have all the necessary information.\n",
    "- **Consistent**: It should follow the same format and standards.\n",
    "- **Timely**: It should be up-to-date and relevant to the current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be working with a Pokemon battle dataset that is from Kaggle. The link to the dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terminus7/pokemon-challenge/data). Kaggle is a wonderful place to find datasets and project ideas.\n",
